					<h6><strong>GUI</strong></h6>
					<p>
						A user interface allows a user to interact with a computer. In particular, a GUI (graphical user interface)
						allows the user to use a mouse to interact with the computer. Microsoft Windows (commonly referred
						to as Windows) is a common GUI used on PCs. The main Windows background screen is called the
						desktop. Programs, files and folders are represented on the desktop by small images called icons. Using
						a mouse, the user can move a pointer across the screen. An icon can be selected by clicking the left
						mouse button (quickly pressing and releasing the button). By holding the pointer over an icon
						(hovering), a text box can be made to appear that explains what the icon represents. This text box is
						known as a tooltip. Double-clicking the mouse (pressing and releasing the button twice in quick
						succession) causes the program, file or folder represented by the Icon to open in a rectangular box on
						the screen called a window. More than one window can be open at a time but the one with the focus is
						known as the active window. Windows can have a vertical scroll bar and a horizontal scroll bar to allow
						the user to move a document up and down or across the screen respectively. A user can drag a selected
						item from one part of the screen to another by holding down the left mouse button while moving the
						pointer. The user can then drop the item at the new location by releasing the mouse button.
					</p>
					<p>
						Commands are displayed in a menu bar along the top of the window. Clicking on a command opens a
						list of choices known as a menu. Clicking on a menu item sometimes opens another related menu called
						a submenu. Common commands include: Find-searches for a word, filename, or folder name; Undo-
						reverses the last action of the user Cut-deletes the selected text, file or folder and copies it to a special
						area of memory called the clipboard; Paste-inserts the text, file or folder stored in the clipboard, at the
						location of the cursor.
					</p>
					<p>
						A bar, known as a taskbar, is displayed along the bottom of the desktop showing what programs, files
						and folders are currently open. At the far right of the taskbar is a special area called the system tray
						where icons are displayed showing what resident programs are continuously running in the background
						e.g. the system clock or a sound volume control. There is a Start button at the far left of the taskbar.
						When the Start button is clicked, the Start menu opens on the screen. The user can close down the
						operating system by choosing the Shut Down option on the Start Menu. A touchscreen allows the user
						to select icons and commands by touching the display screen with their finger instead of using a mouse.
						Graphical user interfaces were first introduced with the Apple Mac OS. Other GUIs with desktops, icons,
						pointers, windows, menus and submenus are also available.
